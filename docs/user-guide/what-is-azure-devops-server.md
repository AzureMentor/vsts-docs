# What is Azure DevOps Server?

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Azure DevOps Server is the on-premises version of our cloud service, [Azure DevOps Services](what-is-azure-devops-services.md).  

Just like Azure DevOps Services, Azure DevOps Server provides an integrated set of features that you access through your web browser or a supported IDE, as follows:

- Git repositories for source control of your code
- Build and release services to support continuous integration and delivery of your apps
- Agile tools to support planning and tracking your work, code defects, and issues using Kanban and Scrum methods
- Many tools to test your apps, including manual/exploratory testing and continuous testing
- Highly customizable dashboards for sharing progress and trends

The Azure DevOps Server ecosystem also provides support for adding extensions, integrating with other popular services, such as: Campfire, Slack, Trello, UserVoice, and more, and developing your own custom extensions.  

When you deploy Azure DevOps Server, you can also configure the following servers or integration points:

- **Build server**: supports on-premises and cloud-hosted builds
- **SQL Server and SQL Analysis Server**: supports SQL Server Reports and the ability to create Excel pivot charts based on the cube

## Where do I start?

- Start for free by downloading [Azure DevOps Server Express](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2041269&clcid=0x409)
- Then, either upload your code to share or source control
- Or, begin tracking your work using Scrum, Kanban, or a combination of methods

Choose on-premises Azure DevOps Server when you need your data to stay within your network. Azure DevOps Server 2019 supports Analytics Service and/or SQL Server reporting services, which is another reason to choose on-premises if you have work tracking customization requirements that aren't supported in the cloud.
